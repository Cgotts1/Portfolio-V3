# Portfolio-V3

This project is titled "Portfolio! Recently Created Web Applications" and serves as a compilation of my most recently created web applications. Potential employers can quickly navigate through the webpage with the header navigation links, that when clicked on, take users to the corresponding titled sections. In CSS, flex was applied to many of the html elements, links to relevant sites were included in the contact/work sections, and media queries enabled for use among other screen resolutions.
